# Viscount

This is a task managing chatbot. It's named after the Java mascot Duke, but not as good hence, _Viscount_.

## Setting up in Intellij

   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.
